[NJCU SCM](https://sites.google.com/view/njcuscm/) and [KACE](https://kace.org/) collaborate to analyze Korean voter turnout in New York/New Jersey

## Background ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

In order to raise the voices of Korean Americans in American society, high voting participation must be accompanied. <br>
To encourage Korean-American voter turnout, NCJU SCM and civic group KACE(Korean American Civic Empowerment) collaborated to analyze voter turnout. <br>
We analyzed Korean Americans in New York and New Jersey, created a dashboard, and used it in a voting encouragement campaign.


## Methods

- Since nationality was not indicated in the data provided by KACE, it was necessary to develop an algorithm to extract only Koreans.
- Extraction was conducted based on a rule base, and a table of Korean surnames and first names was created to extract matching people.
- After extraction, a post-process was conducted with expert feedback.
